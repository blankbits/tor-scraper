# TorScraper
TorScraper is a utility for multi-threaded scraping via the Tor network.

It provides a clean interface for anonymously scraping data from the web
simultaneously through multiple Tor exit nodes. This is useful for maintaining
privacy, circumventing IP blocking and various forms of censorship, and going
beyond what rate limits would otherwise allow.
